<!-- Payday Lending - Custom Payments

  Some payday loans have highly timewise-irregular repayment streams.
  Such custom payments put a special burden on the APR calculation, which
  may end up with an entirely unexpected unit period. 

  Because Payday lending often is the first in line for regulatory scrutiny,
  calculation equipment must be very strong in APR calculations, which is 
  another area were the SCEX and Loan Builder shine.

  This payment stream consists of three fixed payments of fifty dollars, 
  followed by two computed payments.

  The Unit Period for this highly irregular payment stream must be calculated.
  To examine the details of this APR, refer to the adjoining sample.
