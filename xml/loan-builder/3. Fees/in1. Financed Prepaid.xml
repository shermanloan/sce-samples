  <!-- Financed Prepaid Fee
    ShowFees="true" in element "EditOutput" controls the explicit recognition of
    individual fees, both the amortization table and the "Moneys" output.

    Prepaid fees are APR affecting fees that occur on the date of the advance.
    This seventy-five dollar fee is also added to the principal (AddToPrin="true").
    Notice that the prepaid causes the Amount Financed to be different from
    the Principal Balance.
