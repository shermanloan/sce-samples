  <!-- Blended Fee

    Suppose one purchased a warranty to be paid on the first payment.
    Suppose further that this fee was to be a part of a regular stream of
    payments to avoid disclosure of an odd first payment.

    This fee would be computed as described above. 

    Note that the fee is added to principle but not finance charge. The
    reason for this configuration is that the warranty is presumed optional.    

    Set the Blended attribute to "false", and the fee get added to the first
    payment, creating an odd first payment.
