  <!-- Odd Days Prepaid (ODI or Odd Days Interest)

    ODI is a special fee that represents the additional interest beyond
    one unit period to the first payment.

    The first element to understand is how the odd days are computed. 
    A common way is to start at the payment date, move backward one unit period
    then calculate the actual number of days between that date (we call the "anchor date")
    and the date interest begins accruing.

    Mortgages often require the odd days interest to disclose a "daily rate".

    See the "Accrual Codes" in the manual for more on these codes.
