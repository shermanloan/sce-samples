  <!-- Pocket Fee - A fee that's paid outside the parameters of the loan

    If a fee is neither financed nor APR affecting, that fee is paid outside
    the scope of the FedBox and is referred to as an "Out of Pocket Fee" or
    simply a "Pocket Fee". An example of a fee like this would be a
    single premium insurance product that is paid out of pocket (not financed).

    Some reasons these fees may want to be included in the formal loan numbers:
      o The fee is computed on a loan figure, such as the Principal balance
      o All fees applying to the loan keep together for organization and disclosure

    The sample fee is an insurance premium paid out of pocket (not financed) at
    loan closing.
