  <!-- Service Charges - A Service Charge is a fee that's spread out over a payment stream.

    This sample spreads a $50.00 fee over all the payments.

    Set the "CalcType" to "ServChg", the ServChgType to "ByTerm" (divide the $50.00 service
    charge by the term attribute of the FEE) and force all the fees to be
    equal (to ensure all the payments are equal).

    Notice the "Date" has been set to the date of the first payment and that
    the term of the fees is equal to the term of the "PmtStream" element.
