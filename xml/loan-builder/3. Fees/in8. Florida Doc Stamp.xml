  <!-- Florida DocStamp
    ShowFees="true" causes outputs to explicitly recognize all fees as separate entities.    

    A Florida doc stamp is a special type of fee that does not affect
    the APR but is financed (added to Principal). This fee is computed
    as a percentage of the principal balance rounded up to the next $100.

    Calculation: Round Principal UP to the next $100 = 1003.85 up to 1100.00
    Multiply 1100 * 0.35/100 = 3.85
