  <!-- Pure Financed Fee: Intangible Tax (Financed, but non-APR affecting)
    The Florida intangible tax is a fee imposed by the state that's often financed but does not affect the APR.

    The fee is computed as a percentage of the principal, 
    but is often expressed in "mills", or an amount per thousand.
    1 Mill = 0.1 %
    In this sample, the Intangible Tax rate is 2 mills or 0.2%
