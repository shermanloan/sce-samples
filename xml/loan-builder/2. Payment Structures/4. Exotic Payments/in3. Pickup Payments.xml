  <!-- Pickup Payments
    Suppose someone wanted to make an additional thousand dollars 
    to each December payment. These types of payments are referred to
    as "pickup payments". One replaces the desired payments with the new
    payment definition. Since the default payment type is "CalcPmt",
    the following PmtStream definition defines December payments
    as the calculated payment plus the "Amount" defined.
