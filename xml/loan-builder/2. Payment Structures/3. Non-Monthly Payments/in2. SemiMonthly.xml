  <!-- NonMonthly Loans - SemiMonthly Loan
    This loan shows how to compute a SemiMonthly loan, where the "next payment"
    after the initially defined payment is at the end of the month.
    Remove the "SemimonthlyDay" attribute to see the next payment happening
    on the first of the next month, rather than the end of the month.
