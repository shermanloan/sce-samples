  <!-- NonMonthly Loans - Quarterly Loan
    As with the weekly loan, quarterly loans are established by changing
    the PPY attribute, in this case to "4".
    The date of the first payment causes an ambiguity for when the next
    payment is to occur - on the 28th or on the last day of the month.

    The "LastDay" attribute resolves this ambiguity. Set it to "true"
    to make the payments on the last day of each month, rather than the 28th.
