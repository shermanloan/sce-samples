<!-- Roll to Advance: Student Loan

  This sample assumes ten years or 120 monthly payments
  of $300.00 and asks how much the student can borrow in
  two advances, the second of which is $2000.00 more than
  the first.

  The Grace Period and Repayment Period have different
  interest rates and methods of interest accrual.


  The results of the calculation appear in the Amortization
  schedule as Type="Advance" elements.
