  <!-- PmtStream: Compute Term
    To compute the term, set the payment to the desired amount
    then set the term to the maximum permissible (MaxYearsAllowed*PmtsPerYear). 
    Finally, set the ComputeTerm attribute to true.
    LoanBuilder will automatically shorten the term of the loan and return the
    first equal payment loan whose payment is less than or equal to the specified
    desired payment.
